Kinetic theory is a body of theory from statistical mechanics. It is useful in describing the dynamics of a large number of particles, but its high dimensional structure makes the computation infeasible. In multi-scale regimes, however, kinetic equations can be compressed: the Boltzmann equation is asymptotically equivalent to the Euler equations, and the radiative transfer equation is asymptotically equivalent to the diffusion equation, with their detailed information lost. In linear algebra, it is equivalent to a system being of low rank.

I will discuss how the low rank structure forms, and how it affects the computation. In the forward regime, inserting the low-rank structure greatly advances the computation, but in the inverse regime, the system being of low rank typically makes the problems significantly harder.
