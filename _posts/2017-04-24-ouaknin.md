We introduce level set methods to design new algorithms for
self-consistent field theory (SCFT) in polymer physics. SCFT computes
the structure and energy of inhomogeneous self-assembling polymers at
thermodynamic equilibrium. We present a computational framework, encoded
on adaptive quad/oct trees in a parallel environment and introduce the
concept of _shape derivative_ into SCFT. We rigorously derive
expressions for the change of energy of a diblock copolymer melt with
respect to its enclosing shape. The shape derivative is then used to
embed SCFT into a variable shape simulation where the internal structure
and the enclosing shape are coupled and evolve in tandem in order to
reduce the energy. Finally an algorithm for the inverse geometric
problem is presented. The algorithm finds a shape in order to obtain a
desired internal structure of the confined polymeric material.
