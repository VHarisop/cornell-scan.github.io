By viewing the nonuniform fast Fourier
transform (NUFFT) as a perturbed version of an FFT, we
propose a fast and simple algorithm for the NUFFT that adapts
to any working precision. Our accuracy and computational
times are competitive with the state-of-the-art algorithm by
Greengard and Lee. Motivated by the Kadec-1/4 theorem,
we have also been able to fully understand the impact of
nonuniformity on the complexity and stability of NUFFTs.
