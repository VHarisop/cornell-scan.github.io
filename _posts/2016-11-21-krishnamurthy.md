This talk has two parts.  The first part is Bayesian and describes structural
results for partially observed Markov decision processes in multi-agent systems
when individual agents perform social learning.  Two specific examples are
considered.  The first example deals with the so called constrained optimal
social learning problem where the onset of herding is delayed by agents sharing
full information.  The second example deals with change detection when
individual agents perform social learning.

The second part of the talk discusses regret based stochastic approximation
algorithms for learning correlated equilibria in repeated games with Markov
switched parameters.
