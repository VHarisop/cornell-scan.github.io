We present two models of perpetrators' decision-making in extracting resources from 
a protected area. It is assumed that the authorities conduct surveillance to counter 
the extraction activities, and that perpetrators choose their post-extraction paths 
to balance the time/hardship of travel against the expected losses from a possible 
detection. In our first model, the authorities are assumed to use ground patrols and 
the protected resources are confiscated as soon as the extractor is observed with them. 
The perpetrators' path-planning is modeled using the optimal control of 
randomly-terminated process. In our second model, the authorities use aerial patrols, 
with the apprehension of perpetrators and confiscation of resources delayed until 
their exit from the protected area. In this case the path-planning is based on 
multi-objective dynamic programming. Our efficient numerical methods are illustrated 
on several examples with complicated geometry and terrain of protected areas, 
non-uniform distribution of protected resources, and spatially non-uniform detection 
rates due to aerial or ground patrols.
