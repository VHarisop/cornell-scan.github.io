Is it possible to solve an optimization problem using far less memory
than the natural size of the decision variable?  In this talk, we
consider the special case of nuclear norm constrained matrix
optimization problems, and  propose an affirmative answer to this
question when both the problem data and solution have a concise
representation.  We present an algorithm, Sketchy CGM, for provably
solving these problems, whose natural size is $O(n^2)$, using no more than
$O(n)$ memory. SketchyCGM modifies a standard convex optimization
algorithm --- the conditional gradient method --- to work on a
sketched version of the decision variable, and can recover the solution
from this sketch. Importantly, and in contrast to recent work on
non-convex methods for this problem class,  SketchyCGM inherits all the
benefits of convex optimization,  including robustness, flexibility, and
a well understood convergence theory.
