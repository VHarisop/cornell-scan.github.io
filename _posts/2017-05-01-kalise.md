Optimal feedback control design provides a robust and real-time
computable answer to fundamental challenges in modern engineering, such
as active vibration control, fluid flow control, and multi-agent
networks. For an optimality-based formulation of the feedback design
problem, the Dynamic Programming Principle allows the characterization
of the associated value function as the viscosity solution of a fully
nonlinear Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman (HJB) equation, defined over the
state-space of the controlled dynamical system. This talk focuses on the
computation of optimal feedback controllers for multsicale nonlinear
dynamics through the numerical approximation of HJB equations. We will
review recent results concerning optimal feedback control of low and
high-dimensional dynamics arising in the optimal control of partial
differential equations, and agent-based models. We shall also address
different control features such as robustness, sparsity, and multiscale
control design.
