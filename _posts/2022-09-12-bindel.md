Stellarators are non-axisymmetric magnetic field configurations for
confinement of fusion plasmas. In contrast to the more popular axisymmetric
tokamak geometries, stellarators rely on symmetry breaking to confine
particles. The Simons Collaboration on Hidden Symmetries and Fusion Energy is
a team dedicated to advancing the mathematical and computational state of the
art in stellarator design, and producing modern stellarator optimization codes
and new underlying theory.  In this talk, I describe some of the challenges of
stellarator optimization, and give examples both of success stories and of
challenges that remain.
