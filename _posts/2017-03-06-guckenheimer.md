Dynamic mode decomposition, Koopman operators, diffusion maps, equations 
free modeling, Lagrangian coherent systems, finite time Lyapunov 
exponents — are some of the new methods that have been introduced in 
recent decades to analyze dynamical systems. Three lectures will survey 
these methods along with earlier ones of "nonlinear time series 
analysis." The goal will be to describe theoretical principles and 
algorithmic approaches suitable for working with empirical data and 
computer defined systems. Attempts will be made to characterize overlaps 
and features of dynamical problems that distinguish them from other 
areas of machine learning and data science. Don’t expect new results!

The first lecture will review invariant measures for chaotic systems 
together with three ways of quantifying their complexity: dimension, 
Lyapunov exponents and entropy.
