We will solve a class of stochastic optimal control problems numerically, in
which the state process is governed by an Ito type stochastic differential equation with control
process entering both in the drift and the diffusion and is observed partially. The optimal
control of feedback form is determined based on the available observational data. We call this
type of control problems the data driven feedback control. The computational framework that
we introduce to solve such type of problems aims to find the best estimate for the optimal
control as a conditional expectation given the observational information. To make our method
feasible in providing timely feedback to the controlled system from data, we develop an efficient
stochastic optimization algorithm to implement our computational framework.
