I will explain what the NUFFT is, some applications in
science and engineering, and what happens "under the hood" in our new
implementation. This includes a simpler spreading kernel that
accelerates runtimes for the same accuracy, while preserving rigorous
error analysis. I will also sketch some software issues. Along the way
we will discover how the nationally known bluegrass fiddler Tex Logan
fits into the story.

The talk will be accessible to 1st-year graduate students and advanced
math majors.

Joint work with Jeremy Magland.
