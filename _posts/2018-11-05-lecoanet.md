Dedalus is an open-source framework for solving PDEs with global spectral methods. We can solve nearly arbitrary equations in in periodic domains, slab geometry, as well as cylindrical and spherical geometry. I will describe our methods for solving general equations, and give several illustrative examples. Then I will describe efforts to compare Dedalus to different codes in benchmark problems. This will demonstrate the importance of open-source code when trying to reproduce computational results.
