Common wisdom states that spectral methods, based on high
degree polynomials, have spectral accuracy but lead
to dense and ill-conditioned matrices.  The ultraspherical spectral
method is a numerical technique to solve ordinary and partial
differential equations, leading to almost banded well-conditioned
linear systems while maintaining spectral accuracy.  In this talk,
we introduce the ultraspherical spectral method and discuss its
applications and future.
