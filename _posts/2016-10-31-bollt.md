Inferring coupling structure of complex systems from time series data is
a challenging problem in applied science. The reliability of statistical
inferences requires construction of information-theoretic measures
taking into account both direct and indirect influences, manifest as
information flow between the components within the system. We present
application of the optimal causation entropy (oCSE) principle to
identify coupling structure by aggregative discovery for progressive
removal algorithms based on the oCSE principle, from measured data.
