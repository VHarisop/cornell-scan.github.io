In the last few decades, set-valued analysis, as well as analysis of fuzzy-valued functions, has been evolving. Such analysis is of interest itself, and it also finds many applications in various fields of science and technology. In this talk, we consider a generalized concept of functions with values in so-called L-space that encompasses set-valued and fuzzy functions as special cases and allow to investigate them from the common point of view. We will discuss several problems of Numerical Analysis for functions with values in L-spaces and in particular, numerical methods of solution of Fredholm and Volterra integral equations for such functions will be presented.
