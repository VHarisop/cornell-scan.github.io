Multiphase flows in porous media are of critical importance in a number
of areas such as phase separation in engineering devices (e.g.,
coalescers) and CO2 sequestration. Common challenges in these
applications include – among others – the characterization of contact
line motion within complex geometries and the physical discontinuities
at the fluid-fluid interface and fluid-solid interface. Engineering
models for two-phase flows within porous materials often rely on
postulated relations based on Darcy’s law, instead of being built from
phase-averaging exact equations for mass and momentum, along with
first-principle closure models. In this work, we propose a
computationally efficient methodology for simulating two-phase flows
within complex geometries, which relies on an immersed boundary approach
and on a conservative level set technique modified to account for
contact line dynamics. This method is shown to be mass-conserving and
accurate even at limited resolution.  Then we use this newly developed
computational approach to explore the physics of a single droplet
interacting with a single rigid fiber, and two-phase flow displacement
in porous media.
