We consider the spherical perceptron problem: this is the problem of finding a point on the sphere subject to a number of random linear inequalities. This problem and its variants appear in combinatorics, in machine learning as models for one-layer neural networks, and as analytically tractable models for the study of critical properties of jamming of hard spheres. The structure of solutions has been studied in statistical physics, but still poorly understood from the rigorous mathematical point of view.
