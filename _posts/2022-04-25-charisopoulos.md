Subgradient methods comprise a fundamental class of nonsmooth optimization
algorithms. Classical results show that certain subgradient methods converge
sublinearly for general Lipschitz convex functions and converge linearly for
convex functions that grow sharply away from solutions. Recent work has
moreover extended these results to certain nonconvex problems.

In this talk, we ask: is it possible to design a superlinearly convergent
subgradient method? We provide a positive answer to this question for a broad
class of sharp semismooth functions.
