A synthesis of the classic Double Fourier sphere method and new ideas in
low rank approximation is used to construct approximations to functions
in polar and spherical geometries. This approach preserves
bi-periodicity for functions on the sphere, overcomes issues associated
with artificial singularities, enables the use of fast, FFT-based
algorithms, and is near-optimal in its underlying interpolation scheme.
It has been used to develop a suite of fast, scalable algorithms for
numerical computing with functions on the surface of the sphere and on
the disk, and these have been implemented in the Chebfun computing
system.
