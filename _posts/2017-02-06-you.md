A wide range of optimization problems arising in practical applications
can be formulated as  mixed-integer fractional programming (MIFP)
problems, which combine the combinatorial difficulty of optimizing over
discrete variable sets with the challenges of handling the non-convex
fractional objective function. This talk will explore recent results on
the development of tailored global optimization algorithms to address
the computational challenge of solving large-scale MIFP problems. These
MIFP methods will be illustrated through three applications: (1)
function-unit-based life cycle optimization of sustainable product
systems and supply chains under sustainability criterions, (2)
integrated optimization of production scheduling and process dynamics of
continuous multi-grade polymerization reactors, and (3) optimal design
and synthesis of energy processes for the production of algal biofuels
and bioproducts. For each application problem, we will discuss the
modeling framework, solution algorithms, and computational results.
