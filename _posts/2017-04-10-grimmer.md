In this talk, we describe a transformation, which was recently proposed by Jim
Renegar, that can convert wildly non-Lipchitz convex functions into Lipschitz
ones. Based on this, we present a first-order algorithm for solving non-smooth,
non-Lipschitz convex optimization problems. At each iteration, our algorithm
takes a subgradient step and then does a radial projection to ensure
feasibility. This procedure completely avoids computing costly orthogonal
projections, typical of subgradient methods.  In the case of semidefinite
optimization, this replaces solving a hard feasibility problem at each
iteration with eigenvector computations.
