Even though friction has been studied for centuries, its underlying nature has
remained a mystery. One of the main difficulties to study friction is the
challenge of direct observations. Friction occurs at the interface between
solids and is thus hidden behind the bulk material. Modeling friction with
numerical simulations is a promising approach to learn about underlying
interface mechanisms. In this talk, I will present a cohesive modeling
technique for frictional sliding that is originally known from fracture
simulations. I apply this approach to study highly dynamic aspects of
frictional failure and show how numerical studies provide new insights to the
underlying mechanics. I provide quantitative comparison to experimental
observations.
