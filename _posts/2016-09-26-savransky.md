The study of exoplanets (planets orbiting stars other than our own sun)
has gone from a purely academic conceit to a well-established
observational field in only a few decades.  While both ground- and
space-based observatories continue generating a wealth of exoplanet
discoveries and data, future advances in this field will most likely
come from dedicated, space observatories that can directly image and
spectroscopically characterize new and known exoplanets.  The design of
such missions, and analysis of the data they are likely to produce, both
require probabilistically modeling the, only partially observed,
population of exoplanets.  In this talk, I will outline the techniques
being used to analyze and optimize planned missions, and discuss the
inference problem associated with the analysis of current and future
exoplanet data sets.
