Order reduction, i.e., the convergence of the solution at a lower rate
than the formal order of the chosen time-stepping scheme, is a
fundamental problem in stiff ODEs, and particularly in PDE IBVPs.
Runge-Kutta schemes with high stage order provide a remedy, but
unfortunately high stage order is incompatible with diagonally-implicit (DIRK) schemes. We
first highlight the spatial manifestations of order reduction in PDE
IBVPs. Then we introduce the concept of weak stage order, and
demonstrate (a) how it can overcome order reduction in important
linear PDE problems; and (b) that it can recover high-order
convergence with DIRK schemes.
