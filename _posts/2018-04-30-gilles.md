The conjugate gradient method (CG) is the algorithm of choice for solving large symmetric positive definite linear systems. Although self-adjoint elliptic partial differential equations are the differential analogues of symmetric positive systems, their spectral discretizations typically lead to non-normal, ill conditioned systems on which CG cannot operate. In this talk, I present an extension of CG that applies directly to self-adjoint elliptic operators and leads to optimal complexity solvers for the spectral solutions of some PDEs on intervals and rectangular domains. I also discuss extensions to other Krylov subspace methods.
