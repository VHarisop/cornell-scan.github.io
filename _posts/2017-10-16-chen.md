We consider the community detection problem under the Stochastic and
Censored Block Models. We show that the semidefinite programming (SDP)
formulation for this problem achieves an error rate that decays
exponentially in the signal-to-noise ratio. Significantly, even though
we are estimating a combinatorial structure by solving a continuous
optimization problem, this error rate is achieved by the SDP itself
without any further pre/post-processing or rounding. Our results
improve upon existing polynomially-decaying error bounds obtained via
the Grothendieckâ€™s inequality. The analysis highlights the implicit
regularization effect of the SDP, and its robustness in the sparse
graph regime.
