Multidimensional polynomial rootfinding is a common computational challenge in numerical analysis. For the past two decades, practitioners have been deriving numerical algorithms from techniques in algebraic geometry and reporting catastrophic difficulties. In this talk, we summarize the progress in analysing the worst-case stability of two algebraic-geometric methods.
